# Hamster Blogging Platform Frontend

This is an Angular 6 frontend for the Hamster Blogging Platform. It provides the user interface for interacting with the Hamster Blogging Platform Backend API. It also utilises Bootstrap 4 for styling. At the moment, it is only a very basic user interface, used simply for demonstrating the backend API.

* This application will not run without access to the backend API

For this reason, it is best to run it using Docker Compose.

## Installation

Run `yarn install` to install all the necessary packages.

## Build

Run `ng build` or `yarn run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag or `yarn run build:prod` for a production build.

For development purposes, you can run `yarn run build:watch` to watch and automatically compile changes as you make them.

## Testing

There are no unit tests included
